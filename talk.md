**A long time ago in a galaxy far,
far away....**

---

I was a PhD student working on
High Speed Networks Packet Processing

---

Friend: *"Hey, wanna join our Rails shop?"*

---

Me: *"OK"*

---

# [fit] PROBLEM

---

I knew nothing about web development.

---

So I started studying Ruby ![inline](images/ruby-logo.png)

---

But that wasn't enough, so I studied **RoR**

---

But that wasn't enough, so I studied **OOP**

---

But that wasn't enough, so I studied **TDD**

---

And it was **good**.

---

# BUT THEN CAME THE JAVASCRIPT

---

So I learned *jQuery*

---

And it was **great**.

---

Then I learned *KnockoutJS*

---

And it was **awesome**.

---

Then I learned *BackboneJS*

---

And it was **revolutionary**.

---

Then I learned *MarionetteJS*

---

And it was **fantastic**.

---

Then I learned *BatmanJS*

---

And it was so **elegant**.

---

Then I learned *AngularJS*

---

And it was **mindblowing**.

---

# [fit] HYPE FATIGUE

---

![fit](images/hype-cycle.png)

---

I was pretty deep into **The Pit
of JavaScript Disillusionment**

---

You can imagine my reaction when
we decided to use Ember for a new project

---

---

*"Well, I might as well take a look.."*

---

*"This looks nice..."*

---

*"This looks complicated...."*

---

---

So I did some research..
