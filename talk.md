I was a PhD student working on
High Speed Networks Packet Processing

---

Friend: *"Hey, wanna join our Rails shop?"*

---

Me: *"OK"*

---

# [fit] PROBLEM

---

I knew nothing about web development.

---

So I started studying Ruby ![inline](images/ruby-logo.png)

---

But that wasn't enough, so I studied **RoR**

---

But that wasn't enough, so I studied **OOP**

---

But that wasn't enough, so I studied **TDD**

---

And it was **good**.

---

# BUT THEN CAME THE JAVASCRIPT

---

So I learned *jQuery*

---

And it was **great**.

---

Then I learned *KnockoutJS*

---

And it was **awesome**.

---

Then I learned *BackboneJS*

---

And it was **revolutionary**.

---

Then I learned *MarionetteJS*

---

And it was **fantastic**.

---

Then I learned *BatmanJS*

---

And it was so **elegant**.

---

Then I learned *AngularJS*

---

And it was **mindblowing**.

I was pretty deep into **The Pit

You can imagine my reaction when
we chose Ember as our main frontend stack

---

When I was learning Ember, I was learning a piece of software.

---

But the truth is, there are many pieces of software around.

---

You could say: "This is my framework. There are many like it, but this one is mine."

---

But what I found is much more than a framework

---

It's a frame of mind.

---

It's having a true open source process

---

It's thinking about backwards compatibility all the time

---

And that's more important than the software to me.

---

An ambitious application solves a real problem

---

Reality is full of complexity

---

Our job is to manage complexity, not run away from it

---

Never use simplicity as an excuse :)
